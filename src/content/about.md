### Ricardo N Feliciano

Ricardo is a big believer in being the change you want to see in the world.

He's an Ubuntu Linux user because he believes in the open-source movement.
He joined the U.S. Navy Reserves in 2011 because he believes in protecting the freedoms that we've had the privilege to grow up with in this country.
He helps people whenever he can because at one time or another, we all need help.
We all need someone to care.

Ricardo was a Information Systems Technician (IT) in the Navy for 6 years and has been in several software engineering roles at tech companies for the past 9 years.
The Reserve Force is the result of bridging his military and civilian experience and skills together.
