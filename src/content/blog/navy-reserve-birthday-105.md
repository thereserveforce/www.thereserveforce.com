Today, the Navy Reserve turns 105!

Initially known as the Federal Naval Reserve, the United States Navy Reserve was established on March 3rd, 1915 during World War I. The Navy Reserve made up almost 84% of the Navy’s force during the war and has been “Ready Now, Anytime, Anywhere” for over a century.

Since WWI, Naval reservists have been active in every major war the U.S. has fought in. Since September 11, 2001, there have been more than 70,000 mobilizations of Selected Reservists and over 4,500 deployments by Full-Time Support (FTS) reservists.

According to Military.com, on any particular day, a full quarter of the Navy Reserve is hard at work delivering global operational support to our fleet and combat forces.

There is no doubt that the contributions of Navy Reservists over the last 105 years have amplified the Navy’s core capabilities.

Happy Birthday Shipmates!
