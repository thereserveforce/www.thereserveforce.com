In the last few weeks, the Navy has announced some exciting news regarding the technology we use to conduct business. I’ve compiled a list with some brief highlights. Feel free to take a peek!

<!--more-->

Here are some exciting updates that will modernize the way we do business.

	1. Flank Speed (Go Live is June 15th!)
	2. NROWS Update
	3. eNavFit (It's about time)
	4. Issue with accessing Navy Email
	5. Boot Camp for MacOS (M1 systems)

**Flank Speed**

For the last year, during the pandemic, the Navy stood up CVR/Teams as a temporary solution for supporting telework operations. CVR will be replaced with the Navy’s long-term solution, Flank Speed (FS), on June 15th, 2021.

WHAT FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE?

- Teams
- Planner
- One Drive
- Powerpoint
- Word
- Excel
- Forms
- SharePoint
- Outlook
- Calendar
- Tasks
- OneNote

Those with current CVR accounts will be prioritized for migration to FS accounts first with the intent that all users will have an account by the end of FY21.

**Important Note:** Be sure to save all files saved in Teams PRIOR to June 15th as they will not be automatically migrated to Flank Speed or SharePoint.

**NROWS**

The process for Navy Reserve Sailors to create, modify or cancel orders through the Navy Reserve Order Writing System (NROWS) system has been simplified in the latest application software update.

NROWS “Build 43.1” went live April 13, introducing a new program accessibility option. By selecting the “Mobile Optimized” button at the bottom of the NROWS login screen, users are presented a single-page navigation of the entire orders writing system.

The update is available through computer workstations and on Apple mobile devices through the Ready-2-Serve (R2S) application, and offers the ability to navigate the entire orders process in as little as five minutes.


**eNavFit**

Several Navy Reserve commands, units and support centers across the force have been selected to participate in a test pilot program for eNavFit, a modern solution for all Navy Evaluation (EVAL) and Fitness Report (FITREP) processing.

eNavFit is scheduled to replace NAVFIT98A by December 2021. The system will minimize the need for the hard copy routing process, reduce unit-level administrative hurdles, and automate submissions to the Performance Evaluations Division (PERS-32) for entry into Sailor Official Military Personnel File (OMPF) records.

**Issue accessing Navy Email**

Several members have noticed issues with accessing Navy Email lately and have received one of the following errors:

    ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT
    ERR_CERT_REVOKED

If you find yourself having the same issue, follow the instructions [here] (https://www.thereserveforce.com/all/it-assistance/windows/) for installing the DoD Root certificates.

If this does not work for you, drop a comment below!

**Boot Camp for MacOS**

In my last issue of “IT1’s Bits”, I mentioned that brand new Macs with the new CPU called ”M1” did not support Boot Camp. As a reminder, Boot Camp is a utility that comes with your Mac and lets you switch between MacOS and Windows.

Well, I have good news…

Parallels has released an update to its desktop virtual machine software that allows you to install Windows 10 on Arm on M1 Macs. Parallels Desktop 16.5 now includes the necessary native support to run the Arm version of Windows on M1 chips, following Apple’s decision not to support Boot Camp on M1 Macs.
