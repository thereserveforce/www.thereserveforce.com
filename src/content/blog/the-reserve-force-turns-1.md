Happy 2021 everyone!
A year ago today a shipmate and I launched The Reserve Force, our little attempt to give back to our fellow reservists.
Let's recap where we are and where we're going.

## 2020

This was a crazy year, we all know that.
I won't cover what we all already been through.
Instead, I'll say that our first year was decent for The Reserve Force.

Barely anyone visited the website at the beginning of the year.
Starting in the Summer though, we steadily saw a traffic increase.
I'm proud to say that there's now a decent amount of people visiting the site on a weekly basis.
Here's what the last 8 months or so looked like for website traffic:

While everyone was stuck working at home, even for drills, websites such as The Reserve Force suddenly became immensely more valuable.
This is exciting because this is why we're here, to be that valuable online resource.

I'd say that our highlight for 2020 was confirming that this site is useful.
This also makes me **very** excited for 2021.


## 2021

Last year validated the concept for this site opening up the doors for us to do a lot more.
Here's some of the plans for 2021:

**Blogging** - the few blog post we put out last year did well. We will double down on this providing much more written content for those who need it.  
**Mobile apps** - this site is helpful but there's a few ideas we have that will work much better as a mobile app. Expect to see an Android and iOS app from us later this year.  
**Another branch** - while the site has information for all branches of military, the majority of it is for Navy reservists. We're aiming to change that in 2021 by adding more content for at least one more branch.

We'll be sharing more information throughout the year including information on how you can contribute to The Reserve Force and help us out.
